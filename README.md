## "It is not enough for code to work"
Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship 
> ## <pre>SOLID principles are the <br> foundation on which we <br>    can build clean, <br> maintainable architectures.</pre>
***Code Fragility*** 
<pre>
Fragility is the tendency of the software to break in many places every time it is changed.
- Robert C. Martin
</pre>
***Code Rigidity***
<pre>
Rigidity is the tendency for software to be difficult to change, even in simple ways. Every 
change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules.
- Robert C. Martin
</pre>
*Fragility and Rigidity are symptoms of high technical debt.*
***Technical Debt***
<pre>
The cost of prioritizing fast delivery over code quality for long periods of time.

##### Controlling Technical Debt - Continuous code refactor
#### SOLID Principles 
Acronym for 5 software design principles that help us to keep technical debt under control.
1. *S*ingle Responsibility Principle
2. *O*pen Closed Principle
3. *L*iskov Substitution Principle
4. *I*nterface Segregation Principle
5. *D*ependency Inversion Principle

#### Other Ways to Keep Your Architecture Clean
* Constant Refactoring
* Design Patterns
* Unit Testing (TDD)
